# MSP PC Builder

This project's live site: https://msp-pc-builder.vercel.app

## Available Scripts, libraries, database, and other resources

In this project, I used the most potent libraries, database, hosting live server for the frontEnd

### Used technologies-

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) - The official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development.
- [Ant Design (Antd)](https://ant.design/) - A popular React UI library with a set of high-quality components.
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - A framework for React that enables server-side rendering and other optimizations.
- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) - An authentication library for Next.js applications.
- [Sharp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharp) - A high-performance image processing library.
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) - A static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns in JavaScript code.

### Deployment-

Used Next.js authentication with Google and GitHub Providers . for deploying beside were being used https://vercel.com/

### Description

This repository contains the front-end code for the PC builder website. The website allows users to build and customize their own PCs by selecting different components like CPU, GPU, RAM, storage, etc. The website is built using React and utilizes various libraries and technologies.
The purpose of a PC build website is to provide a platform or tool that helps users design and create their custom personal computers based on their specific needs and preferences. These websites typically offer a user-friendly interface where users can select individual computer components, such as the CPU, GPU, RAM, storage, motherboard, and power supply, among others, and build their desired PC configuration.

### Acknowledgments

- Thanks to all the contributors who made this project possible.
- Special thanks to the maintainers of the open-source libraries used in this project.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>=14.x) installed on your system.
- npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
